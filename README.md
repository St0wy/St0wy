### Hi there 👋

I'm Stowy ! I've been stuying programming since 2016 and I'm currently a student at the SAE Institute Geneva in Games Programming.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning C++, Networking, Graphics programming and Rust on the side
- ⚡ Fun fact: Since 2016, I've used at least 8 programming languages. I love to learn new ones to see how they each differ
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on any project that can make me learn new things on games programming
- 📫 How to reach me: [stowy@protonmail.ch](mailto:stowy@protonmail.ch)
